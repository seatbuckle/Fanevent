Fanevent

Faneventâ€™s purpose is to give communities the ability to organize and sign up for local events. The goals include providing a website that delivers on our purpose, and maintaining said website with moderation tools. The main problem Fanevent aims to solve is the difficulty of finding events in one's own communities.
